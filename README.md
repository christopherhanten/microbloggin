I am working on this microblog page.
I am pretty excited about it.

Tonight (12/12) I am starting slow, blocking out the sections of the page. Putting in the the posting box and the submit button.

I am having fun with it. I will be able to change out all the pieces, when the time comes, to get it really profesh.

What I need to figure out now is how to move mb posts into a feed. Oh man!-->

How do I get the very top portion of the page colored?
I figured this ^^ out!

Now, how do I get the bullet points from the <ul> go away?
I figured this ^^ out!
